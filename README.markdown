##Description
Joke is a simple rackup script that turns a directory into a quick and dirty, PHP style web application using ERB. This means that you access code directly from the URL (example: http://localhost:9292/index.rb) and deal with params yourself via $_GET, $_POST, or $_REQUEST. 

##Features
- print_r and vardump
- <? and ?> tag support
- array(1,3,4)

##Installation
git clone this repository and run rackup within it to see it in action.
